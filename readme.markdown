By default, these are available as [HTML](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/) or [plaintext](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/41127).

## File extension

There's a plethora of Markdown file extensions, but I have decided to go with `markdown`. Read why:

> *"We no longer live in a 8.3 world, so we should be using the most descriptive file extensions. It’s sad that all our operating systems rely on this stupid convention instead of the better creator code or a metadata model, but great that they now support longer file extensions."*

> *"…the only file extension I would endorse is “.markdown”, for the same reason offered by Hilton Lipschitz"*
